# Tutorials
All robotics code must be written in Java. As such, new coders should review at least one Java tutorial. Returning coders only need to refresh on Java syntax.  

This coming robotics season, I would like to use Git to manage our code. Git is a common version control system that keeps track of the changes made to code. Coders who do not know how to use Git should follow the Learn Git Branching tutorial.

## Java
- [The Official Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/): At least the "Language Basics" lesson in the "Learning the Java Module" should be read if following this tutorial.  
- [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-how-to-code): According to Codeacademy, this tutorial/course takes around 6 hours. I haven't taken this course, but it seems if you follow this tutorial, you should complete all modules.  
- [Alex Lee](https://youtu.be/RRubcjpTkks): A very basic 14 minute YouTube tutorial on Java. The teacher uses Eclipse, but you can just use a text/code editor like VSCode, especially since the code is being run on the robot - not a laptop.
- [Java 8 Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/): The full, official Java documentation. This is not a tutorial.  

## Git
- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/): Probably the best Git tutorial to exist. You only really need to do the intro sequences in the main and remote sections. However, I would recommend doing all of the levels, just because it'll be useful in the future, especially if you're intending to pursue coding further.  
- [Git Cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf): Good for referencing Git commands
