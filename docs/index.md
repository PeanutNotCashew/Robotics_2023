# Home
Welcome to the BSGE Robotics home!

> Our Google Classroom code is `6kiftur`.

Currently, there is no day set for when we will begin to meet. <(＿　＿)>

See our code repository at: [https://github.com/PeanutNotCashew/Robotics_2023](https://github.com/PeanutNotCashew/Robotics_2023).

## What are we doing now?
For the rest of the school year, we plan on conducting design and coding clubs for club members, creating an inventory of our robotics materials, ordering new parts, and fundraising.
